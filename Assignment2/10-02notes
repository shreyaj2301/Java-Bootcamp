Topic: Data Types, variables and operators

Data Type - Type of data


Q. Is java statically typed or dynamically typed language?
- Java is a statically typed language

Statically typed language -
Whenever we want to store something in programming/java we have to tell what type of data we are going to store.

128 64 32 16 8  4  2  1
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

0, 1 is nothing but a bit.
 
8 bits group - 1 byte


Numbers - 
	byte -> 1 byte - 8bits  (-128 to 127)
	short -> 2 byte - 16bits (-32768 to 32767)
	int -> 4 byte - 32bits (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1)
	long -> 8 byte - 64bits (-2^63 to 2^63 - 1)


Decimal Numbers-
	float - 4 byte  - 32bits
	double - 8 byte  - 64bits
	
Characters -
	char - 2byte - 16bits

Boolean -
	boolean - 1bit


byte > short > int > long > float > double > char > boolean
Primitive datatypes - These are the datatypes which holds only single value.


String -
	String



Variables - 
	Name given to a memory location
	Named memory location


Syntax - 
data_type varaiable_name = value;


rules to define name of a varaiable -> 
	accountNumber
	account_number
	AccountNumber
	account_Number

Keywords - Reserved words in java
	e.g - byte, short, int, long, double, float, class, public, static, void


Identifier - It is a name given to a class, varaiable or method

	Identifier must contain characters only from a-z, A-Z, 0-9, $, _
	Identifier must not begin with any digit e.g 0accountnumber->X, 18accountnumber-> X, account18, _accountnumber, $accountnumber.
	Identifier must not be any keyword.

	int _byte = 21; - X


Standards -> 
Class - always start with a capital letter
Variables - always starts with a small letter or underscore or dollar



Operators -> Operations
It is symbol used perform some operations on any values
The data on which we perform operations is called operand


 10 + 10

+, -, *, /, %

Types of operators
	-Arithematic operator: +, -, /, *, %


Assignment -

8 datatypes -> for each datatype perform all the arithematic operator
5 operators

mixed operation check ki error, answer.
12 mixed with there outputs and the errors.
