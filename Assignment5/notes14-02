        -Assignment Operator ✅
        -Bitwise Operator ✅
        -increment/decrement operator ✅




Liretal - It is a value that we store inside any variable


Assignment Operator -
    =

    a = a + b;
    a += b;

    a = a - b;
    a -= b;

    a = a * b;
    a *= b;

    a = a / b;
    a /= b;

    a = a % b;
    a %= b;


Bitwise Operators - &, |, ^, ~, >>, <<, >>>, <<<.

increment and decrement operator - 

    post increment and post decrement

    pre increment and pre decrement


a = a + 1;
a += 1;
a++;

a = a - 1;
a -= 1;
a--;

a++ -> post increment
a-- -> post decrement

++a -> pre increment
--a -> pre decrement



assignment -> 21 programs of increment and decrement operator
10 programs on assignment Operators;
