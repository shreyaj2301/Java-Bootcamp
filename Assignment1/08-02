Computer - Compute [calculations]
input -> processes -> output

0 and 1

0 no voltage

What is a software? group of multiple programs

Programming -> Writing instructions to the computer to get the task done.

Programming Language -> It is a languaguare used by programmers to communicate with the computer


Binary Language -> 


Assembler -> Used English 


High Level Language -> 
C, C++, Java, Python, etc.



Core Java -> 
	Platform independent - why?
	Simple (removed complex concepts like pointers, virtual function, memory allocators, memory management)
	Object Oriented Language -> It is a way to represent real world entities in programming e.g a chair. It has four legs(properties). Anyone can sit on the chair(Behaviour)


C -> 

code -> compiler -> binary code .exe

Platform - nothing but our Operating System (Windows, linux, IOS, Ubuntu)

Platform Independence -> 

Machine Understandable Code - Binary Code - Low Level Code

Java Code -> Compiler -> Intermediatory code/ Byte code -> platform independent -> binary code

WORA - write once run anywhere


jdk - java development kit

jre - java runtime environment -> platform dependent

JVM - java virtual machine -> platform dependent




Frontend -> Wahtever we see on the screen is called as frontend

Server - A machine that is ON 24/7.


Types of Application -
	Standalone Applications - Something which does not requires Internet
